# RustyTree
A simple 3D renderer written in Rust. 

## Plan
Draw vertices in a three dimensional space.
Connect these vertices with edges.
Define faces enclosed by edges.
Place normals on these faces.
Define bodies enclosed by faces.
Cut bodies along edges to flatten them.
Apply textures to the flattened body.
